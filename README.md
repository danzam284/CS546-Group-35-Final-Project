## Introduction
For this project, we plan to implement a web application that allows users (Stevens students) to review professors after taking their course! Participants will be able to review the professor and future students will be able to obtain an accurate representation of course requirements/expectations. 
## Core Features
1. Main Page: A sign in page 
2. User-Login Page: Allow users to sign in, but posts are anonymous.
3. Search for Professor: Search for a professor by professor name.
4. Search for Class/Course: Search for a course by course name.
5. Make a review / post Page: Create a review on a professor or course.
6. Delete a post: users can delete a post they made
7. User account: Accounts can be created with username/password
8. Add a professor: Add a professor to the database to be rated
9. Add a class/course: Add a course to the database
## Extra Features
1. Filter professors by rating for each course
2. Admin login to edit posts, discussions, and reviews on website
3. Report a post and allow admins to view reported posts

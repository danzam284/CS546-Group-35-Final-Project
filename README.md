## **Introduction**

For this project, we plan to implement a web application that allows users (Stevens students) to review professors after taking their course! Participants will be able to review the professor and future students will be able to obtain an accurate representation of course requirements/expectations. 


## **Core Features**



1. Main Page: A sign in page 
2. User-Login Page: Allow users to sign in, but posts are anonymous.
3. Search for Professor: Search for a professor by professor name.
4. Search for Class/Course: Search for a course by course name.
5. Make a review / post Page: Create a review on a professor or course.
6. Delete a post: users can delete a post they made
7. User account: Accounts can be created with username/password
8. Add a professor: Add a professor to the database to be rated
9. Add a class/course: Add a course to the database
10. Filter professors by rating for each course
11. Admin login to edit posts, discussions, and reviews on website
12. Report a post and allow admins to view reported posts


## **Extra Features**



1. Discussion area for each class
2. Filter professors by rating (different from core feature 10 because is a general search, not dependent upon course)
3. Stevens student verification (check if email contains stevens.edu and use email validation API to ensure it exists).
